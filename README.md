# learn-aws
Learning to automate AWS traditional, microservice, and serverless environments. Building a self-registration app using Flask and PostgreSQL. Inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8inzn5/so_you_want_to_learn_aws_aka_how_do_i_learn_to_be/

# Traditional
Successully built load-balanced, auto-scaling site on EC2 which uses flask for the front-end and postgres to store data. Currently working on automating the entire provisioning process.

Next steps: Serve from static S3 bucket. 
Use Route53 for DNS.
Enable SSL.

# Microservice
Coming later.

# Serverless
Coming later.
